# AdobeSignCSharpSdk
Just as to official Adobe Sign SDKs, this cSharp aims at providing an easy way to integrate the Adobe Sign RESTful web service into client applications through easy to consume client side objects wrapping the REST API functionality. This repository contains Adobe Signâ€™s SDK in cSharp to integrate with Adobe Sign v1 to v6 REST APIs.

Only the cSharp Rest API clients are included in this solution for now. In the near future examples just as Adobe includes in the JS & Java SDKs will be included here.
